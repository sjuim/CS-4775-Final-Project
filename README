How to Reproduce our Results:
1. Download Data in the form of fasta files from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/VirusVariation/Database/nph-select.cgi?taxid=186536 with the following settings to get congo_nucleoproteins.fa:
    Sequence Type: Protein
    Species: Any
    Host: Human
    Region/Country: Democratic Repulic of the Congo
    Genome Region: Nucleoprotein
    Isolation Source: Any

2. Clean data using cleanData.ipynb in order to ensure sequences are all the 
same length. The output will be congo_nucleoproteins_padded.fasta. Also, we
shortened the labels for sequences by leaving only the ID and date and removing
'|Homo sapiens|Democratic Republic of the Congo'. The file with shortened labels
is congo_nucleotide_fix_names.fasta.

3. In order to produce our figures and results for the Parsimony method, one can
run parsimony.ipynb and obtain the parsimony.nwk and Parsimony_tree.png outputs.

4. To produce our results for the UPGMA method, run biopython.ipynb. To produce 
our results for the neighbor joining method, run biopython.ipynb using the neighbor 
joining method DistanceTreeConstructor instead of UPGMA. This is how one can obtain
our NJTree.nwk file and UPGMATree.nwk file as well as UPGMATREE.png.

5. To produce our results for maximum likelihood, run the topiary.ipynb file. Thus,
one can obtain the topiary.png output.

6. To produce our results for the Bayesian method, use the BayesianMCMC.nexus file.

7. Our analysis with RF Topological Distances can be reproduced via the
TopologicalTreeDistance.Rmd file.
